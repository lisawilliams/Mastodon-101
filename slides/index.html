				<section><h3> What is Mastodon?</h3></section>
				<section>
					<li>Mastodon is a decentralized, federated social network. </li>
					<li> Anyone can set up a Mastodon server. </li>
					<li> But you can talk to people who are not on your own server. 		</li>
				</section>
				<section><h3>How many people are on Mastodon?</h3>

					About 7 million. <br>
					That's tiny compared to Twitter (237 million), YouTube (2.6 billion) or Facebook (2.9 billion). <br>

					<em>Note: Numbers gathered in Nov. 2022.</em>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>There seem to be a lot of alternative social networks out there right now.</h3>

					True: right now the most commonly mentioned ones are Post, Cohost, and Hive.

					<section><H3>What is the fediverse?</H3></section>

					<section>
						The fediverse is more than just Mastodon. <br>
						Mastodon is just one type of software; but there are many others including PeerTube (think federated YouTube) or Pixelfed (think decentralized Flickr or Instagram).<br>
						<br>Regardless of what an individual server is running, they share communication protocols like ActivityPub that let them interact across servers.<br>
